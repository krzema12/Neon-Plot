Neon Plot - Python function plotter
===================================

(screenshot)

This application lets you draw single variable mathematical functions, expressed in Python (so any expression that returns a number can be treated as such function). It lets you draw multiple functions at once, move around the graph and save/load the functions from an XML file.

To any contributors or just curious guys "why this code is so ugly". I wrote it in about 3 days, for a university project. I'm not proud of this code (i.e. it's not elegant), it's a proof of concept or a demo of the technology. I'm planning to prettify the code a bit, so it should be easier for you to contribute in any way. Plus, the university project requirements were that the application must communicate with the user entirely in Polish. This, of course, will be changed, too (a proper i18n, probably).
